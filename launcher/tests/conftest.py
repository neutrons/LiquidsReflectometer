# --- Process-wide settings redirect, installed at IMPORT ---------------------
# Qt caches the settings root at the first QSettings construction in a process.
# A fixture cannot win that race: any module constructing QSettings at import or
# collection time would already have bound the developer's real ~/.config for
# the whole session. setPath is consulted per construction, so installing it
# here — before collection — is what actually isolates.
#
# Both formats are redirected: setDefaultFormat(IniFormat) governs new
# QSettings(), but anything constructing NativeFormat explicitly would escape a
# single-format redirect.

# --- What the teardown frees -------------------------------------------------
# Only the windows a test made and nothing else owns: a parentless top-level
# widget of one of these types. Everything else is freed by its owner: a pop-up
# (a QCompleter's list, a QMenu), a tooltip, a splash screen, the rarer types,
# and any window with a parent. A QCompleter holds its pop-up through a raw
# pointer and deletes it in its own destructor. When the teardown freed every
# top-level widget, the pop-up was freed twice whenever Qt listed it before its
# window. The run then crashed in QCompleter::~QCompleter (gdb) under the flush
# at the end of _drain_test_windows. That happened in 5, 8, 7, 7 and 8 of 12
# subprocess runs of
# test_harness.py::test_teardown_survives_an_open_completer_popup; under this
# rule, 0 of 12 in each of four runs. The cost: a parentless pop-up that nothing
# owns is left to die with the process, a leak rather than a crash. Types are
# compared exactly, since Tool is Popup|Dialog as bits.
